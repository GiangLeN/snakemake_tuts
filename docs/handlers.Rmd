The handlers are built-in functions in Snakemake.

***onstart*** is executed before the workflow.
It can be used to perform setup or initialization tasks before the rules in the workflow are executed.

***onsuccess*** is activated when the workflow is finished without error.

***onerror*** is as the name implied, trigger when Snakemake failed due to error.

> Note: The handlers are not triggered by dry run

Here's an example of how to use these handlers in a Snakemake workflow:

```
onstart:
    print("Starting workflow...")
    # Setup files using snakemake
    shell("snakemake --cores 2 -s scripts/others.smk --use-conda")

rule all:
    input:
        "output/output.txt"

rule create_output:
    output:
        "output/output.txt"
    shell:
        "echo 'Hello, world!' > {output}"

onsuccess:
    print("Workflow finished, no error")

onerror:
    print("An error occurred")
    shell("mail -s "an error occurred" youremail@provider.com < {log}")
```

In this example, the onstart at the beginning of the Snakemake prints a message to the console indicating that the workflow is starting.
Another snakemake script is activated.
This script could be used to setup for the main script.

The workflow rules are defined.
There are two rules in this example: rule all and rule create_output.
The rule all specifies that the final output of the workflow is the file output/output.txt.
The rule create_output generates this file by running a shell command that writes the text "Hello, world!" to the file.

Once the workflow is completed it then print another method "Workflow finished, no error".
